                    <h2>Why a KLE500</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've had my KLE since 2014, purchased used and is needed some work.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'd had bikes in my youth since I was 17 yeasr of age.
                       
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        After rearching and considering several models if bkie from differnt manufatures I decided in the KLE.
                    </p> 
                    <h4>The mains reasons being:</h4> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Styling: I just love the way it looks.</li>
                        <li>The Weight: It's not to heavy to pick up by myself if I drop it.</li>
                        <li>The Engine:  It has the incrediably reliable and bullet proof GPZ500 engine.</li>
                        <li>The Price:  It was a good buy 2nd hand as they was never very popular when new so few people know aboyt them.</li>
                    </ul> 
                </div>
                <div class="text-boxs" id="my-return">
                    <h2>A Return</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a returner to motorcycling, having had bikes back in my youth after passing my test at 17.
                        I guess I took after my father who after leaving the army had sevaral BSA and Triumph motorcycles, 
                        this was way before myself and my brother came along and ruined her biking days!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My My first being a Yamahas DT125 trail bike, then a Suzuki TS250, another trail bike.
                        I had a preference trail bikes due to their upright riding position, excellent for getting through traffic.
                        After having both bikes stolen I decided to get my Car driving licence and move to four wheels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I hit mid life crisis I decided I decided I wanted to return to motorcycling. 
                        I did research and decided it was a choice between one of the dual sport bikes taht were available at the time.
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Honda Translap</li>
                            <li>Suzuki DR400</li>
                            <li>KLE500</li>
                            <li>Yahmaha Tenere</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>I obviously deided to go with the KLE </p>

                    <article><h2>Dual Sport & Adventure Bikes</h2>
                        <p>
                            Dual Sport and Aveture bikes are a specific catagour of motrocycles. In recent years that have become incresingling popoular. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They are intended for the adventurous time who require a bike capable of both on road
                            and off road riding. 
                        </p>

                            The general idea of a go anywhere bike for long touring adventures. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dual Sport were the original aventure bike, basically the early bikes were off road bikes with headlight and bigger fuel
                            tanks. Adventure biked came along with more refinment and specificationsm such as ABS and, bigger engines and better road handling.
